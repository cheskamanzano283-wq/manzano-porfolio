# Reflection
  Creating my personal portfolio website was both challenging and rewarding. One of the main challenges I faced was organizing the layout and making sure each section looked clean and responsive. At first, I struggled with aligning elements using CSS and linking the navigation buttons correctly, but through online tutorials, documentation, and a bit of trial and error, I was able to fix the issues and make everything function properly. Another challenge was ensuring that the site looked appealing on different devices. Learning how to use Flexbox and media queries helped me make the design adaptable. It also taught me how important patience and attention to detail are when coding. If I were to improve my portfolio next time, I’d like to add more animations, include a gallery of my works, and make the site more interactive with JavaScript features. I also plan to enhance the design by using better color combinations and transitions. Overall, this project helped me appreciate how creativity and technology come together—and it inspired me to keep improving my web development skills.
